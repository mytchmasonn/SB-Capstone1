> Q1. What goal will your website be designed to achieve? 

A1. The goal of the site was initially just a fun little idea, maybe to allow me to be lazy and not have to take and send multiple screenshots and hope the person sees the idea I’m trying to portray. Now, my brain sees it as somewhat reminiscent of GraphQL, specifically, GraphQL + Relay, strictly in the sense of not over fetching data/saving the user from loading far too much. They are not the same, but the idea behind GraphQL helped me justify this project idea. 

> Q2. What kind of users will visit your site/what is the demographic of your users?

A2. I’m not sure there’s a specific demographic. That being said, it certainly is an idea which is probably not understood, in the sense of why it’s useful, to those outside of the tech-loving/tech-savvy world. 
 
> Q3. What data do you plan on using?

A3. From the API, the vast majority, if not all of it, is basically just a request to process the information. Possibly show accepted types of data, but most of the use of the api is to process the request itself.

> Q4. In brief, outline your approach to creating your project

 >> Q4.1. What does your database schema look like? 
 
A4.1. My database schema will be relatively small. At the moment, I think the only data 
I’ll be needing (or wanting) to store will be users/user info, along with some form of
history of the user’s previous conversions or similar. 

>>Q4.2. What kinds of issues might you run into with your API?

A4.2. Realistically, the only issues I can think of would be a request limit.

>>Q4.3. Is there any sensitive information you need to secure? 

A4.3. Technically, no. However, I may go ahead and make user accounts.

>>Q4.4. What functionality will your app include?

A4.4. At the moment (as I’m sure I’ll want to add more), I only need to allow a user to
submit a website (or HTML) to be converted into a PDF. I’m hoping to add more 
(meaningful) functionality as well!

>>Q4.5. What will the user flow look like? 

A4.5. Login/Signup > homepage(location of functional..stuff) > plug and play!
